    followers/following tab, follow button on the corresponding
    followed/unfollowed userBanner doesn't reflect change

  > Add top friends table? Add a search bar?

  > make user card more aesthetic. possibly add other details,
    like following/followers count. maybe QR code? share link?

  > add feedback tab to allow users to send feedback messages.
    deliver messages via automated email.

    no malicious intent with user emails, security warnings,
    and known risks.


-- ItemTable/ItemModal
  > refactor into functional components
